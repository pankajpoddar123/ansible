Example Conditionals

Equal (value is a string)           ansible_facts['machine'] == "x86_64"
Equal (value is numeric)            max_memory == 512
Less than                           min_memory < 128
Greater than                        min_memory > 256
Less than or equal to               min_memory <= 256
Greater than or equal to            min_memory >= 512
Not equal to                        min_memory != 512
Variable exists                     min_memory is defined
Variable does not exist             min_memory is not defined
Boolean variable is true.           memory_available
The values of 1, True, or yes
evaluate to true.

Boolean variable is false.          not memory_available
The values of 0, False, or no
evaluate to false.
not memory_available

First variable’s value is          ansible_facts['distribution'] in supported_distros
present as a value in second
